# CO₂ Emissions Forecasting & Biogas Conversion 🌱
Time Series Forecasting for CO₂ Emissions with ARIMAX

### 🚀 Project Overview
Indonesia faces a major challenge in reducing CO₂ emissions caused by key sectors like industry, transportation, and waste. This project reimagines CO₂ not just as a problem but as an opportunity. By converting CO₂ emissions into biogas — a clean and renewable energy source — we aim to reduce carbon emissions, accelerate the clean energy transition, and boost Indonesia's economic growth (GDP).

This study applies Time Series Forecasting with ARIMAX to analyze CO₂ trends and uncover the impact of biogas on the national economy.

### 🔎 Business Problem
High dependency on fossil fuels increases CO₂ emissions.
Managing emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources like biogas is crucial to achieving Net Zero Emissions by 2050 while sustaining economic growth.

### 💡 Business Solution
By leveraging ARIMAX forecasting, this project provides insights into:

Reducing CO₂ emissions through biogas conversion.
Increasing the share of renewable energy in the national energy mix.
Supporting GDP growth by improving energy management and creating job opportunities.

### 📊 Key Insights & Recommendations
🌴 High Biogas Potential: Major opportunities in the palm oil sector, with the largest distribution in Riau, Sumatra, and Kalimantan.
🔋 Clean Energy Transition: Biogas development reduces reliance on fossil fuels and helps achieve Net Zero Emissions.
💼 Economic Impact: Scaling biogas installations can boost GDP through job creation and cost savings in energy production.
